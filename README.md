# Dotfiles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/niraami/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/niraami/dotfiles)
Dotfiles - synonym for: *I'm never using linux again If I lose these files*.

This might be a bit of a strange dotfiles setup, but I'm doing everything in a way, that If I wanted to reinstall, I could do it in < 1 hour. Though this means, that these dotfiles install pretty much all of my essential apps, dependencies & their respective configs.

## Installation
*Please backup any of your previous configuration, the installation will* ***not*** *ask your permission to replace/delete any of your local files*.

After cloning, just run the `install` script. It's quite possible that it may ask for sudo permissions if there are any packages being installed, or links created outside of the `home` path.  
If you also want to install all of the optional dependencies (mostly apps), run `install -c opt.conf.yaml`.   
Same goes for spotify & it's skin, run `install -c spotify.conf.yaml`.

These dotfiles use [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot "github.com/anishathalye/dotbot") to manage the installation & [Travis-Arch](https://github.com/mikkeloscar/arch-travis "github.com/mikkeloscar/arch-travis") to make CI via Travis possible.
